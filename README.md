# Node Express Mysql Full Stack

### Overview

In this assignment, you'll create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express and a homemade ORM (yum!). Be sure to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app.

### Read This

When trying to connect remotely to your Heroku database on an open network such as a coffee shop, library, or even your University WiFi, it will be blocked. If you are experiencing a Heroku connection error, this could be why.

### Important

* **This assignment must be deployed.** Be sure to utilize the [MYSQL Heroku Deployment Guide](../../Supplemental/MySQLHerokuDeploymentProcess.pdf) in order to deploy your assignment.

### Before You Begin

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* Each burger on the right side of the page will have a `Delete Button`.  When the user clicks delete, it will be removed from the db and the page.

* [You can see a working demo here.](https://kferg-eat-da-burger.herokuapp.com/).

## Instructions

#### App Setup

1. Create a GitHub repo called `burger` and clone it to your computer.

2. Make a package.json file by running `npm init` from the command line.

3. Install the Express npm package: `npm install express`.

4. Install MySQL npm package: `npm install mysql`.

#### DB Setup

1. Inside your `burger` directory, create a folder named `db`.

2. In the `db` folder, create a file named `schema.sql`. Write SQL queries in this file that do the following:

   * Create the `burgers_db`.
   * Switch to or use the `burgers_db`.
   * Create a `burgers` table with these fields:
     * **id**: an auto incrementing int that serves as the primary key.
     * **burger_name**: a string.
     * **devoured**: a boolean.

3. Still in the `db` folder, create a `seeds.sql` file. In this file, write insert queries to populate the `burgers` table with at least three entries.

4. Run the `schema.sql` and `seeds.sql` files into the mysql server in MySQLWorkbench.

#### Config Setup

1. Inside your `burger` directory, create a folder named `config`.

2. Create a `connection.js` file inside `config` directory.

   * Inside the `connection.js` file, setup the code to connect Node to MySQL.

   * Export the connection.

3. Create an `orm.js` file inside `config` directory.

   * Import (require) `connection.js` into `orm.js`

   * In the `orm.js` file, create the methods that will execute the necessary MySQL commands in the controllers. These are the methods you will need to use in order to retrieve and store data in your database.

     * `selectAll()`
     * `insertOne()`
     * `updateOne()`

   * Export the ORM object in `module.exports`.

#### Model setup

* Inside your `burger` directory, create a folder named `models`.

  * In `models`, make a `burger.js` file.

    * Inside `burger.js`, import `orm.js` into `burger.js`

    * Also inside `burger.js`, create the code that will call the ORM functions using burger specific input for the ORM.

    * Export at the end of the `burger.js` file.

#### Controller setup

1. Inside your `burger` directory, create a folder named `controllers`.

2. In `controllers`, create the `burgers_controller.js` file.

3. Inside the `burgers_controller.js` file, import the following:

   * Express
   * `burger.js`

4. Create the `router` for the app, and export the `router` at the end of your file.

#### View setup

1. Inside your `public` directory, create `assets/js/burgers.js`.
2. Inside your `public` directory, create `index.html`.


#### Directory structure

All the recommended files and directories from the steps above should look like the following structure:

```
.
├── config
│   ├── connection.js
│   └── orm.js
│ 
├── controllers
│   └── burgers_controller.js
│
├── db
│   ├── schema.sql
